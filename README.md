## Installation

Please, after cloning the repo, run the command line "npm i" to install the depenicies from npm.com.

This api currently uses:
Express
mongoose pacakges

You will also need to have the MongoDB CLI in-order to interact and with the database. I would recommaned using Mongo Compass to view the database in real time! It is a helpful application, similar to sql workbench, that has a useful UI for interacting directly with the Mongo Database or chekcing the data being updated directly to the server.

<a name="usage"></a>

## Usage

All that is required to use this API (currently) is a code editor and have mongoDB CLI downloaded in-order to build the database and interact with it. i.e CRUD operations

## Testing

I would recommand testing this before adding to a web application with [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

You can test each route included in the control files to see each operation works and wont return you an error.
